## Todos

- Ensure incrementing or decrementing progress on a show is properly reflected in the page
- Ensure adding a show to PTW or marking as completed will cause a re-render
- Ensure each ID is unique for a given user and cannot be added more than once
- Start work on designing the statistic page
- Start work on designing the activity functionality
