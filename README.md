One click show search - Instead of spending hours discovering new shows through online forums or thinking of complicated search filters, scroll through your preferred flavor of new shows in one click

## Dashboard

With the dashboard, you can track all your current shows, filter and search through your shows, and look at your stats, all in one page

## Todos

- Ensure incrementing or decrementing progress on a show is properly reflected in the page
- Ensure adding a show to PTW or marking as completed will cause a re-render
- Ensure each ID is unique for a given user and cannot be added more than once
- Start work on designing the statistic page
- Start work on designing the activity functionality
